# Disable unwinding as it relies on external libraries
# The eh_personality language item marks a function that is used for implementing stack unwinding. By default, Rust uses unwinding to run the destructors of all live stack variables in case of a panic. This ensures that all used memory is freed and allows the parent thread to catch the panic and continue execution. Unwinding, however, is a complicated process and requires some OS-specific libraries (e.g. libunwind on Linux or structured exception handling on Windows), so we donâ€™t want to use it for our operating system.
